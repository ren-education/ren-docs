- Ensure PDF contains text, not just images
- Some PDFs are image-based and cannot be searched

**File Corruption**:
- Re-create PDF from original source
- Try different export/save method
- Check original document for issues
- Scan physical documents again if necessary

### Performance and Speed Issues

**Slow Loading or Response**:

**Browser Optimization**:

### Using AI Assistant Strategically

**Before Starting Assignments**:
```
"I'm about to start my history essay on the Civil War. Can you help me understand what makes a strong thesis statement for a historical analysis?"
```

**When Stuck Mid-Assignment**:
```
"I'm halfway through my math problem set and I'm confused about how to approach word problems. Can you walk me through a strategy?"
```

**After Receiving Feedback**:
```
"My teacher said my essay needs better transitions between paragraphs. Can you explain what good transitions look like and give me some examples?"
```

**During Study Sessions**:
```
"I'm studying for my science test on ecosystems. Can you quiz me on the different types of relationships between organisms?"
```

### Time Management Excellence

**Assignment Planning**:
- **Large projects**: Start 2-3 weeks early
- **Regular assignments**: Begin 3-4 days before due date
- **Reading assignments**: Break into daily chunks
- **Study sessions**: Use spaced repetition over cramming

**Deadline Management**:
- **Submit early**: Aim for 1-2 days before deadline
