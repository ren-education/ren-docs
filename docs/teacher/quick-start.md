By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:

-   Set up your first class
-   Add students efficiently
-   Create and manage assignments

## Step 1: Create Your First Class

Classes are the foundation of your Ren workspace. Each class contains students, assignments, and all related materials.

1. **Navigate to Classes**: Click on "Classes" in the main sidebar
2. **Create New Class**: Click the "Create Class" button

    - **Class Name**: Use a descriptive name (e.g., "Grade 10 English", "AP Biology Period 3")
    - **Subject**: Select or enter the subject area
4. **Save**: Click "Create Class"

Your new class will immediately appear in your dashboard and sidebar navigation.

## Step 2: Add Students to Your Class

2. Go to the "Students" tab
3. Click "Add Student"
4. Enter the student's name and email (optional)
5. Click "Add"

(Optional) Include the students' emails, and invite them to access the students' dashboard:

1. From the Students tab, click "Generate Invite Link"
2. An email will automatically be sent to them with the instructions to join Ren

💡 **Tip**: Each student gets a unique access token - they don't need separate accounts!

## Step 3: Create Your First Assignment

Assignments in Ren are designed around PDF submissions and AI-powered analysis.

1. **Navigate to Assignments**: From your class, click the "Assignments" tab

    - **Description**: Add instructions or context for students
    - **Due Date**: Set the deadline
    - **Instructions**: Any specific requirements
4. **Save**: Click "Create Assignment"

## Step 4: Handle Student Submissions

### Upload Submissions (Teacher Upload)

If students submit work offline or you're uploading scanned work:

1. Go to your assignment dashboard
2. Find the student's row
3. Click the upload icon next to their name
4. Select and upload their PDF file
5. Status changes from "Pending Submission" to "Processing" then "Ready for Grading"

### Student Portal Submissions

Students can submit directly through their unique portal link:

-   After you sent the invitations, they should receive a link to the student dashboard
-   They can view assignments and upload their own submissions
-   You'll be notified when new submissions arrive

## Step 5: Your First Grading Session

Once submissions are processed, you can begin grading:

1. **Access Submission**: Click on a student's name in the assignment
2. **Review the PDF**: The submission loads in an interactive PDF viewer
3. **Create Snippets**: Click and drag to highlight important sections
4. **Add Feedback**:
    - Tag snippets with categories (e.g., "grammar-error", "good-analysis")
    - Add detailed comments
5. **Assign Grade**: Enter the numerical grade
6. **Save**: Click "Save" to finalize
